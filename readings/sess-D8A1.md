This card suggests that the seeker is filled with happiness and a sense of accomplishment as they embark on this new venture. It signifies emotional contentment and a wish coming true.

2. **Soil (10 of Cups Reversed):**
The 10 of Cups, when reversed, symbolizes disharmony in relationships and a lack of emotional fulfillment within the family or close connections.

It's essential for them to address these issues to create a stable foundation.

3. **Shadows (10 of Pentacles):**
